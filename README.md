# Anemia & Cancer Predisposition & Erythropoiesis

Several bone marrow failure syndromes have anemia as their major clinical feature. However, they have in-common other things, most unexpectedly - significantly increased cancer predisposition. \
Cancer predisposition is link to bone marrow failure syndrome, not to anemia in general. In this project I am going to utilize some publicly available datasets on several anemias to investigate the specific fetures of bone marrow failure syndrome predisposition to cancer. \

* *Hematopoietic public datasets.ipynb* notebook is for **loading, quality control, annotation, and integration** of 5 single-cell RNA-Seq datasets for Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Disease, Aplastic Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, Fanconi Anemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome (with 5q deletion).
